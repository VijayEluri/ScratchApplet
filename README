Java Decompiler Test,
using Web Browser Java Applet ScratchApplet.jar
from MIT Scratch http://scratch.mit.edu/

Result: Fernflower from http://www.reversed-java.com/fernflower/ is AMAZING
(except that his site doesn't work on Chrome & Safari, only Firefox).

JD from http://java.decompiler.free.fr/ works but is far behing (for this JAR at least)

JAD & DJ (which appear to be the same, one old OSS and the other annoyingly $$$) are astonishingly useless!
